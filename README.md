### 📅 2025-08-04 – First Setup & Data Loading

**What I did:**
- Created project folder structure with `app/`, `notebooks/`, `data/` etc.
- Set up Heroku and GitHub deployment, tested live Streamlit app.
- Added `Procfile`, `requirements.txt`, `runtime.txt`, `setup.sh`.
- Created a minimal `app.py` and deployed successfully to Heroku.
- Set up `.ipynb` notebook environment in VS Code for the first time.
- Installed pandas, jupyter, openpyxl to be able to work with Excel data.

**Data loading:**
- Downloaded raw wildlife collision data from viltolycka.se.
- Loaded Excel files from multiple years (2015–2024) using `glob` + `pandas.read_excel`.
- Concatenated all sheets into one big DataFrame.
- Will soon save as a CSV for faster future use.

**Why I did it:**
- Heroku deployment early makes it easy to test dashboard features later.
- Notebook setup helps me explore the data and test code without cluttering the main app.
- Exporting all Excel to CSV simplifies the next steps (cleaning, modeling, Streamlit use).
