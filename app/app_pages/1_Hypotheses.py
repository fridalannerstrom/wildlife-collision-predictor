### Hypothesis 1  
**Moose collision rates increase during autumn months (Septemberâ€“November).**

*Rationale:* Moose are more active during mating season, increasing road crossings and collision risk.

---

### Hypothesis 2  
**Wildlife collisions are more common at dawn and dusk.**

*Rationale:* Many animals are crepuscular (active at dawn/dusk), which aligns with times of reduced visibility for drivers.

---

### Hypothesis 3  
**Certain counties experience more wildlife collisions regardless of time of year.**

*Rationale:* Geographic and environmental differences (e.g. forest coverage, traffic density) may result in consistent regional risk patterns.
