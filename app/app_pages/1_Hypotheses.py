st.markdown("""
To guide the analysis and prediction model, three testable hypotheses were formulated:

---

### ü¶å Hypothesis 1: Moose collision rates increase during autumn  
> The number of moose collisions significantly increases during the autumn months (September‚ÄìNovember).

---

### üåÖ Hypothesis 2: Wildlife collisions are more common at dawn and dusk  
> Most wildlife-vehicle collisions occur during early morning or late evening hours.

---

### üó∫Ô∏è Hypothesis 3: Certain counties experience more collisions regardless of season  
> Some counties (l√§n) have significantly higher wildlife collision frequencies even when controlling for time of year.

---

These hypotheses are explored and validated through visual analysis and help guide model development and recommendations.
